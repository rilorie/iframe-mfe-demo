This is a test repository that shows how to render a microfrontend (MFE) using iframes. 

You need to ensure that iframe-content has been started in order for this to work (`localhost:9000`)

Now, navigate back to this project and start the server:

`npm install`
`npm run start`

Now navigate to `localhost:3001`. You should see the application mounted in an iframe.
